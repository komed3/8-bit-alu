# 8-bit arithmetic logic unit

Project to build an 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) consisting only of transistors. Further on, the construction of a transistor processor based on this ALU will follow.

## Input

The inputs of the arithmetic-logic unit are the two 8-bit wide data words ``A`` and ``B``, and 8 control lines, defined below.
